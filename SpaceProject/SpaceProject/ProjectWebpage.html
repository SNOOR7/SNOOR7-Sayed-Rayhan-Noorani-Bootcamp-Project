    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Space Project</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a beginnners understanding 
	of the use of arrays, randomness, classes and 3D. I created a space scene in which 
	details of each star (e.g. position, color and size and shape) are stored in arrays.
	Stars are arranged with random sizes between 1 and 3, this creates the sparkle and
	creates the impression of space. Next was creating the 3D planets and having them be placed 
	in order of closest to the sun. I then added rotation to each planet and to the Sun and
	gave each of them lighting to give of a realistic feel in regards to the reflection of the
	suns light. Finally, I added a feature where the user can press a key
	(first letter of the planet's name) to swap the middle planet that is default selected as Earth.
	This part was supposed to much cooler as you could hover your mouse over the planet 
	to select it and the stats for the selected planet would show 
	(i.e. temp, size compared to Earth, distance from the Sun, etc...). 
	Unfortunately, I ran out of time for that. :(
